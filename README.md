# blackjack
This app was created using Vue.js and makes use of the https://deckofcardsapi.com/ API and some of its functions.
We used Axios to handle promises from the API and built it in Javascript.

To run it, simply NPM install then 'npm run serve' the client directory.

KNOWN ISSUES

Currently working on why exactly the player Blackjack state is not functioning.
Certain card draws cause the Ace logic to break and not count values properly, so working on that too!

FUTURE ADDITIONS

Looking to add betting and a persistant player bank with a Spring launched database
